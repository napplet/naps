NAP-INTENT
==========

Archetype Intent Dispatcher
---------------------------

`draft`

**NAP ID:** NAP-INTENT
**Domain:** `intent`
**Web binding (NIP-5D):** `window.napplet.intent` · `shell.supports("intent")`

## Description

NAP-INTENT provides napplets with a shell-mediated interface for invoking *another* napplet by its **archetype** — a shared role name such as `note`, `profile`, or `emoji-list` (see [ARCHETYPES.md](../ARCHETYPES.md)). A napplet describes *what role* it wants, *what action* to perform, and *what payload* to deliver; the shell resolves the role to an installed napplet, applies the user's default-handler preference, creates or focuses the window, and delivers the payload. This is the napplet equivalent of an operating system's implicit intents with a "default application": the caller names a role and an action, never a specific napplet.

The model maps directly onto a proven pattern (Android-style implicit intents): the **archetype** is the intent category, the **action** is the intent action, the **payload** is the extras, and the user's default handler is the default app. NAP-INTENT standardizes the **envelope**, not the payload. The `payload` is opaque and MAY be tagged by a `convention` field naming the unnumbered topic/action payload shape, such as `note:open` or `profile:open`. This keeps routing and parsing independent without forcing developers through a numbered registry before napplets can interoperate:

- **archetype** — *routing*: which napplet should handle this, and whose default applies.
- **convention** — *parsing*: what payload shape the handler expects.

The two are orthogonal (N:M): one convention may serve several archetypes, and one archetype may accept several conventions. Resolution of an archetype to a concrete napplet — including which napplets fulfill which roles and which is the user's default — is shell policy. Napplets never address each other directly.

## API Surface

| Operation | Parameters | Result | Wire |
|-----------|------------|--------|------|
| `invoke` | `request` (`IntentRequest`) | `IntentResult` | `intent.invoke` / `intent.invoke.result` |
| `open` | `archetype` (`tstr`), optional `payload` (`any`), optional `opts` (`IntentOpenOptions`) | `IntentResult` | sugar over `intent.invoke` with action `"open"` |
| `available` | `archetype` (`tstr`) | `IntentAvailability` | `intent.available` / `intent.available.result` |
| `handlers` | none | `[* IntentAvailability]` | `intent.handlers` / `intent.handlers.result` |
| `onChanged` | handler for `IntentAvailability` | `Subscription` handle | `intent.changed` |

### Schemas

```
IntentBehavior = {
  ? focus: bool,
  ? newWindow: bool,
  ? reuse: bool,
}

IntentOpenOptions = {
  ? convention: tstr,
  ? handler: "default" / "choose" / tstr,
  ? behavior: IntentBehavior,
}

IntentRequest = {
  archetype: tstr,
  ? action: tstr,
  ? convention: tstr,
  ? payload: any,
  ? handler: "default" / "choose" / tstr,
  ? behavior: IntentBehavior,
}

IntentCandidate = {
  dTag: tstr,
  ? title: tstr,
  actions: [* tstr],
  conventions: [* tstr],
  ? isDefault: bool,
}

IntentAvailability = {
  archetype: tstr,
  available: bool,
  candidates: [* IntentCandidate],
  hasDefault: bool,
}

IntentResult = {
  ok: bool,
  archetype: tstr,
  action: tstr,
  handled: bool,
  ? handler: tstr,
  ? windowId: tstr,
  ? convention: tstr,
  ? error: tstr,
}
```

`action` defaults to `open` when omitted. `payload` is opaque and shaped by
`convention` when present.

**`invoke(request)`** — Asks the shell to dispatch `action` (default `"open"`) to a napplet of `archetype` with `payload`. The shell resolves the archetype to a handler (the user's default, the napplet named in `handler`, or a user choice when `handler: "choose"`), creates or focuses its window, and delivers the payload using the named `convention` (or the archetype's recommended default when `convention` is omitted). The `action` is carried as a field, not encoded into the message type, so new actions never expand the wire surface. Returns once the handler has been resolved and the window created; delivery to the handler MAY complete asynchronously.

**`open(archetype, payload?, opts?)`** — Convenience sugar for `invoke({ archetype, action: "open", payload, ...opts })`, the common case.

**`available(archetype)`** — Returns whether the runtime can currently satisfy `archetype`, the candidate napplets that fulfill it, and the actions and conventions each supports. This is the pre-flight guardrail: a caller checks availability before showing an affordance, so a missing handler fails loudly at the call site instead of silently at delivery. Availability is sourced from the **installed-napplet catalog** (the manifests the runtime knows about), so it reports `true` for an installed handler that is not yet running.

**`handlers()`** — Returns availability for every archetype the runtime can currently satisfy. Useful for menus and capability surfaces.

**`onChanged(handler)`** — Registers for shell-pushed availability updates, fired when a napplet is installed or removed, or a default handler changes.

## Wire Protocol

`intent.*` messages use the NIP-5D wire format (`{ "type": "domain.action", ...payload }`).

| Type | Direction | Payload fields |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| `intent.invoke` | napplet -> shell | `id`, `request` |
| `intent.invoke.result` | shell -> napplet | `id`, `result`, `error?` |
| `intent.available` | napplet -> shell | `id`, `archetype` |
| `intent.available.result` | shell -> napplet | `id`, `availability`, `error?` |
| `intent.handlers` | napplet -> shell | `id` |
| `intent.handlers.result` | shell -> napplet | `id`, `handlers`, `error?` |
| `intent.changed` | shell -> napplet | `availability` |

Key design notes:
- Request/result pairs use `id` for correlation.
- The **action is a field** (`request.action`), never part of the message type. `intent.invoke` is the single dispatch verb for `open`, `edit`, `pick`, `share`, and any future action.
- `intent.changed` is a shell push message and has no `id`.
- The shell delivers `payload` to the resolved handler using the named `convention`'s ordinary delivery mechanism — typically an INC topic event (e.g., `note:open`), or initial state passed at instantiation for a cold-started handler. NAP-INTENT governs resolution, default handling, and window lifecycle; the convention governs the payload shape.
- `convention` and `archetype` are independent. The shell MUST NOT assume a one-to-one mapping between them.

### Examples

**Conditionally show an "add emoji list" button, then open it:**
```
-> { "type": "intent.available", "id": "a1", "archetype": "emoji-list" }
<- {
     "type": "intent.available.result",
     "id": "a1",
     "availability": {
       "archetype": "emoji-list",
       "available": true,
       "candidates": [
         { "dTag": "emojilistr", "title": "Emoji List Maker", "actions": ["open"], "conventions": ["emoji-list:open"], "isDefault": true }
       ],
       "hasDefault": true
     }
   }
-> {
     "type": "intent.invoke",
     "id": "i1",
     "request": {
       "archetype": "emoji-list",
       "action": "open",
       "payload": { "seed": ["🤙", "⚡"] },
       "behavior": { "focus": true }
     }
   }
<- {
     "type": "intent.invoke.result",
     "id": "i1",
     "result": {
       "ok": true,
       "archetype": "emoji-list",
       "action": "open",
       "handled": true,
       "handler": "emojilistr",
       "windowId": "win-12",
       "convention": "emoji-list:open"
     }
   }
```

**Open a note using a specific convention:**
```
-> {
     "type": "intent.invoke",
     "id": "i2",
     "request": {
       "archetype": "note",
       "action": "open",
       "convention": "note:open",
       "payload": { "target": { "type": "event", "id": "abc..." } }
     }
   }
<- { "type": "intent.invoke.result", "id": "i2",
     "result": { "ok": true, "archetype": "note", "action": "open", "handled": true, "handler": "noteview", "windowId": "win-13", "convention": "note:open" } }
```

**No handler installed:**
```
-> { "type": "intent.invoke", "id": "i3", "request": { "archetype": "emoji-list", "payload": {} } }
<- { "type": "intent.invoke.result", "id": "i3",
     "result": { "ok": false, "archetype": "emoji-list", "action": "open", "handled": false, "error": "no handler" } }
```

### Error Handling

Result messages MAY include `error` when the request cannot be fulfilled. Common errors include `"unknown archetype"`, `"no handler"`, `"unsupported action"` (the resolved handler does not support the requested `action`), `"unsupported convention"` (the resolved handler does not accept the requested `convention`), `"user cancelled"` (during an "open with…" prompt), and `"invoke failed"`.

The shell SHOULD return a structured `result` with `ok: false` and `handled: false` when resolution or delivery fails. A caller that wants to avoid the failure path SHOULD call `available()` first.

## Shell Behavior

- The shell MUST resolve an `archetype` to a handler using its catalog of installed napplets and the user's default-handler preference for that archetype.
- The shell MUST keep a user-overridable default per archetype. When a default exists, `invoke` without an explicit `handler` MUST route to it.
- The shell SHOULD offer an "open with…" chooser when `handler: "choose"`, or when no default exists and more than one candidate is available.
- The shell MUST source `available()` / `handlers()` from the installed-napplet catalog (signed NIP-5A manifests), not from currently-running instances, so not-yet-running handlers are discoverable.
- The shell MUST respond to every request with a result message carrying the same `id`.
- The shell MUST deliver `payload` to the resolved handler only after that handler is ready to receive it.
- The shell MUST NOT let a napplet learn the identity of, or address, another napplet except through this resolution. Callers name roles, never instances — unless the user has explicitly granted a specific `handler` dTag.
- The shell MAY reject an `invoke` whose `action` or `convention` the resolved handler does not support, or MAY fall back to the archetype's recommended default convention.
- The shell SHOULD emit `intent.changed` when the catalog or a default changes.

## Security Considerations

- Dispatching an intent is a navigation and focus-stealing action. Shells SHOULD treat `invoke` as an untrusted request and MAY rate-limit or require a user gesture, especially for `behavior.newWindow` or `behavior.focus`.
- Archetype resolution is a trust boundary. A napplet asking for `archetype: "note"` MUST NOT be able to coerce the shell into routing to an arbitrary napplet; only the user's default or an explicit user choice decides the handler. The `handler: "<dTag>"` form SHOULD require that the user has authorized cross-napplet targeting for the caller.
- Payloads cross a napplet boundary. The shell relays `payload` opaquely; the receiving napplet MUST treat it as untrusted input and validate it against the named `convention`. The shell SHOULD NOT inspect or mutate payload contents beyond what routing requires.
- `available()` reveals which napplets are installed, which is a fingerprinting surface. Shells MAY scope or redact candidate details (e.g., omit `dTag`/`title`) per policy while still answering `available`.
- Default-handler settings are user state. Shells MUST NOT let a napplet silently set or change a default; changing a default is a user action.
- Cold-start delivery (passing initial payload at instantiation) MUST NOT leak the payload to napplets other than the resolved handler.
